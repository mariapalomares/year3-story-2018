			<h3>Epilogue</h3>
			<article>
				<p>Lord Adler died two days after we found him. The poisoning with silver and other heavy metal caused him a painful death. We attended his funeral
				and we were summon to appear before the magistrates upon the same day. What we found down the passage will leave a deep trace in my memory. The corridor
				when down about 100 meters and ended in a big illuminated room. Nothing there seemed ordinary, four big tables where located beside the wall, in the center	
				a big pot was still warm. Over the table we found heavy metals like lead, silver and aluminium, and lab equipment for an alchemist.</p>

				<p>However, the different experiments that Lord Adler was performing not only involved metals, but human flesh. We found on the 
				corner a cage with two little children dead for no more than a week, as well as three human hearts.Lestrade found a pile of documents that 
				implicated a more than a dozen of people only in London and almost a hundred in all England. It seems that Lord Adler sold the idea of having found the philosophical stone.
				Upon the promise of 'the elixir of life', he got all kind of elements for his experiments, even human beings.</p>

				<p>Holmes explain to Miss Adler and Lestrade how he discover everything. "The first clue was the blood on the wall, I knew from the moment
				I saw it that it had traces of silver. Then, after analysing the box and the gardener's piece of paper, I came to the conclusion that so many metals were
				only possible if Lord Adler had worked in a mine or in an alchemist lab." said Holmes. "But how did you know where the lab was?" asked Miss Adler. 
				"When I broke the wall to get Lord Adler's secret box, I noticed a current of air coming from the wall." said Holmes.</p>
