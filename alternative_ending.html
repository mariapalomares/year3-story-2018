				<p>That morning Holmes had left early only leaving a note for me. The note said: "Meet me at the harbour at 6pm, a cab will get you there. Bring your pistol. S.H.".
				I wasn't surprise about the pistol, the case was dangerous and I was sure I'd need it. Around 5.30pm a cab was waiting at the door. That evening there was a cold wind
				and the newspaper warned about some snow for the night. I got to the harbour and Holmes was there hidden after some old nets beside a building.
