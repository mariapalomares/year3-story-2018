				<p>That morning Holmes had left early only leaving a note for me. The note said: "Meet me at the harbour at 6pm, a cab will get you there. Bring your pistol. S.H.".
				I wasn't surprise about the pistol, the case was dangerous and I was sure I'd need it. Around 5.30pm a cab was waiting at the door. 
				That evening there was a cold wind and the newspaper had already warned about some snowfall for the night. I got to the harbour and only a few souls were wandering.  
				Holmes was there, somewhere, probably hidden. Suddenly I felt a cold hand touching mine, I jump and turned around. A little boy in rags wispered something and gave
				me a note.

				<p>"Walk 100 meter toward the end of the peer and board the ship 'Santa Michaella', I will be waiting for you on the deck. S.H.". I ran and boarded the ship, the deck
				was full of boxed ready to unload, a couple of sailors were smoking and chatting beside to starboard. Sherlock was beside the helm with a spyglass in his hands. He was looking at the peer, in the same direction I had come from. "Come here,
				Watson, quickly!" exclaimed Holmes. I did as I was instructed, Holmes handed me another spyglass and pointed at another ship called 'The Blue Heaven'. We wait 
				for over an hour, the ship was loaded and it seemed ready for setting sail.</p>

				<p>Suddenly, Miss Adler boarded the ship, she was accompanied by a maid and a man. Probably, one of her servants. After them, two men loaded a large box, similar to a coffin.
				Holmes took out a pistol and shoot to the air. In that moment, Lestrade and his men surrounded the ship and we ran there. Holmes inspected the coffin and turned to
				Miss Adler, "Do you think if we open it we will find Lord Adler?" said Holmes. "I am not interested in your judgement, I was forced to contact you. I knew
				it would be difficult to distract you..." said Miss Adler. The police took all of them down to the station. When we opened the box, Lord Adler's body was cover by 
				precious stones. "It seems that Lord Adler stole a great amount of gems and rubies in Africa, and had already booked his passage in a ship to America. However, Miss 
				Adler found out about his plans. My theory is that they had a discussion and Miss Adler stabbed him in the same bedroom where we found the message. Of course, I knew the blood
				in the message was the blood of a dead man, but I decided to follow her steps until she led me to Lord Adler's body tonight." said Holmes while we were
				heading back to Baker Street.
