			<h3>The Stone</h3>
			<article>
				<p>Sherlock and I went to Lord Adler's house and inspected the room. We also talked to the staff that was working that week.
				One of the gardeners was peculiar in some way. When Sherlock was starting to question him, he ran. We went
				after him and we caught him just leaving the property. But something went wrong, before we could face him, he swallowed something. Before we could question
				him, he died. In one of his pocket we found a piece of paper with the words 'Magnum Opus'.</p>

				<p>'Magnum Opus' is the process of working with the <i>prima materia</i> to create the philosopher's stone" said Holmes while we were waiting for Lestrade 
				in the house.
				"Do you think this is why Lord Adler disappeared? It is possible that he was experimenting how to create a philosopher's stone during his time
				in Africa and some people got interested in his findings. Of course, all this alchemy business is just pure charlatanism. " I exclaimed. 
				Holmes was pensive but suddenly he left the room and went upstairs. I did not have time to react when I heard his steps in Lord Adler's room. I heard 
				like he was moving some kind of furniture.</p>

				<p>When I got to the room, Holmes had in his hands what appeared to be a red stone, he had taken it out from a box hidden into the wall, just behind 
				the wardrobe. "Not very imaginative" I thought. The box had 3 birds painted on the top of it, a raven, a swan, and a phoenix. "The birds represents the
				progression through the four stages of creating the Philosophical Stone. It is believed that the philosophical Stone can turn base metals into gold. But it has 
				also been called 'the elixir of life' because it is useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality" said Holmes. I thought that something like that, even though
				I could hardly believe that it would be possible to achieve, it was a perfect motive to make someone disappear.</p>

				<p>Holmes paid special attention to the piece of paper. We went back to Baker Street and Holmes spent the whole night 
				in his lab analysing the box and the piece of paper. I couldn't really sleep. I had a bad feeling about this case, it all seemed like the tip of the iceberg.
				Definitely, there was something fishy about the gardener and Lord Adler.</p>
