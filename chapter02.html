				<p>Sherlock and I went to Lord Adler's house and inspected the room. We also talk to the staff that was working that week.
				One of the gardeners was peculiar in some way. When Sherlock was approaching him, he started to run. We went
				after him and we caught him just leaving the property. But something went wrong, before we could face him, he swallow something. Before we could question
				him, he died. In one of his pocket we found a piece of paper with the words "Magnum Opus".</p>

				<p>"'Magnum Opus' is the process of working with the prima materia to create the philosopher's stone" said Holmes while we were waiting for Lestrade 
				in the house.
				"Do you think this is why Lord Adler disappeared? Is it possible that he was experimenting how to create a philosopher's stone during his time
				in Africa and some people got interested in his findings. Of course, all this alchemy business is just pure charlatanism. " I exclaimed. 
				Holmes was pensive but suddenly he left the room and went upstairs. I did not have time to react when I listened his steps in Lord Adler's room.
