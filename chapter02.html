				<p>Sherlock and I went to Lord Adler's house and inspected the room. We also talk to the staff that was working that week.
				One of the gardeners was peculiar in some way. When Sherlock was approaching him, he started to run. We went
				after him and we caught him just leaving the property. But something went wrong, before we could face him, he swallow something. Before we could question
				him, he died. In one of his pocket we found a piece of paper with the words "Magnum Opus".</p>
