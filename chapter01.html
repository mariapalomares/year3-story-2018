				<h5>The red woman</h5>
				<p>Baker street was quite and the snow was falling when Holmes arrived waking me up in an upsetting way. 
				I suppose after all these years I am not yet used to his ways. He looked at me and said: <br>
				-Dress up, we have an important appointment.
				<br>
				10 minutes had passed when a beautiful woman crossed the door with 2 servants and a maid. She was dressed in red, bright and rich. 
				The dress was made of fabrics I had never seen before. Anyone could see that she was very rich and not the 
				type of person to come to 112 Baker Street. So that must have been a very interesting case for Holmes.
