			<h5>The red woman</h5>
			<article>
				
				<p>It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like
				the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. Baker street was quiet when Holmes arrived waking me up in an upsetting way. 
				I suppose after all these years I am not yet used to his ways. He looked at me and said: <br>
				-Dress up, we have an important appointment.
				<br>
				10 minutes had passed when a beautiful woman crossed the door with 2 servants and a maid. She was dressed in a red dress, the colour was bright and rich. 
				The dress was made of fabrics I had never seen before. Anyone could see that she was very rich and not the 
				type of person to come to 112 Baker Street. So that must have been a very interesting case for Holmes. As for myself, I was silent,
				for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirit.
				We all sat down an Holmes commanded me to take notes of the conversation.

				<p>"Miss Adler has a story to tell us. Please, Could you tell us what brings you to Baker Street?", the detective said. "Mi colleague, Mr. Watson, 
				is here and will collaborate in the case". 
				"Mister Holmes, thank you for receiving  me. The story is as follows: my husband, Lord Adler, spent the last 2 years in Africa and last week return with 
				no previous notice. Everything was different. He came back alone, leaving my brother-in-law behind and in a paranoid state. The first two days he did not leave 
				his room. I am certain that he was really afraid of something but he refused to talk to me or anyone." Miss Adler said with a cold tone "and the reason
				I am here is because yesterday morning Lord Adler went missing and we found in his room a disturbing message written on the wall".
				"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood" Holmes said "and had the following message: The philosophical stone is only mine".

				<p>We continue talking for one more hour and when Miss Adler left, I was certainly feeling very weary. I left Holmes
				seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailing of
				his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.
				 We would not talk until next day.
