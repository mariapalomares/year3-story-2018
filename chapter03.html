				<p>"It can be a coincidence," he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; "It is impossible that it should be 
				a mere coincidence. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched stone is none the worse.
				Ah, I have it! I have it!" With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, looked at the stone. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, 
				and wiped the perspiration from his forehand. "I should have more faith", he said; "I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed
				to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing other interpretation. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the stone at all".
				This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the stone, however, to 
				prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim,
				vague perception of the truth.</p>

				finally uncover the truth and the one that will give us more information about Lord Adler's whereabouts. Lestrade and I exchanged glances and when went
				we arrived Holmes led us upstairs. But this time not to Lord Adler's room, but to Miss Adler's. Mis Adler's room was bright and tidy, however it gave me the creeps.
				There was something, more like a cold welcoming, a cold... In that moment, Holmes broke the wall with his foot and a dark passage appeared in front of our eyes.</p>
