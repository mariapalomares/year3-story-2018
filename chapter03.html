				<p>"It can be a coincidence," he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; "It is impossible that it should be 
				a mere coincidence. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched stone is none the worse.
				Ah, I have it! I have it!" With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, looked at the stone. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, 
				and wiped the perspiration from his forehand. "I should have more faith", he said; "I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed
				to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing other interpretation. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the stone at all".
				This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the stone, however, to 
				prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim,
				vague perception of the truth.</p>

				<p>Holmes had called Lestrade and the three of us went to Lord Adler's house in a cab. Holmes had everything ready for his final act. The one that will
				finally uncover the truth and the one that will give us more information about Lord Adler's whereabouts. Lestrade and I exchanged glances and when 
				we arrived Holmes led us upstairs. But this time not to Lord Adler's room, but to Miss Adler's. Miss Adler's room was bright and tidy, however it gave me the creeps.
				There was something, more like a cold welcoming, a cold... In that moment, Holmes broke the wall with his foot and a dark passage appeared in front of our eyes.</p>

				<p>I hesitated for a moment, but Holmes had long entered the passage with Lestrade and both had dissapeared from my sight. I took a lamp and followed them.
				The passage was made of large stones, dark stones built the walls and thin steps lead the way down. There was a smell of something I could not recognized, 
				but it was unpleasant and I was starting to feeling sick. I heard a gun shoot and quick steps were coming into my direction. I raised the the lamp with my
				left hand and I tooken my pistol and point at the dark. "Holmes, Lestrade" I yelled "Who is there? What is happening?". I could hear the steps getting closer.</p>
