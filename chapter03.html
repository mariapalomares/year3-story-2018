				<p>"It can be a coincidence," he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; "It is impossible that it should be 
				a mere coincidence. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched stone is none the worse.
				Ah, I have it! I have it!" With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, looked at the stone. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, 
				and wiped the perspiration from his forehand. "I should have more faith", he said; "I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed
				to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing other interpretation. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the stone at all".
				This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the stone, however, to 
				prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim,
				vague perception of the truth.</p>

				<p>Holmes had called Lestrade and the three of us went to Lord Adler's house in a cab. Holmes had everything ready for his final act. The one that will
				finally uncover the truth and the one that will give us more information about Lord Adler's whereabouts. Lestrade and I exchanged glances and when 
				we arrived, Holmes led us upstairs. But this time not to Lord Adler's room, but to Miss Adler's. Miss Adler's room was bright and tidy, however it gave me the creeps.
				There was something, more like a cold welcoming, a cold... In that moment, Holmes broke the wall with his foot and a dark passage appeared in front of our eyes.</p>

				<p>I hesitated for a moment, but Holmes had long entered the passage with Lestrade and both had dissapeared from my sight. I took a lamp and followed them.
				The passage was made of large stones, dark stones built the walls and the steps lead the way down. There was a smell of something I could not recognized, 
				but it was unpleasant and I was starting to feeling sick. I heard a gun shoot and quick steps were coming into my direction. I raised the lamp with my
				left hand, I took my pistol and pointed at the dark. "Holmes, Lestrade" I yelled "Who is there? What is happening?". I could hear the steps getting closer and there was 
				no answer from Holmes yet.</p>

				<p>"Stop! or I'll shoot" I said. For a moment I thought about all possible scenarios. So, I run toward the entrance of the corridor, It was better to face whoever was
				running in my direction from there. I got to the room and locked the door. I pulled some furniture as barricade and wait pointing my pistol at the corridor. I could not believe what
				I saw a few minutes later. "It is Lord Adler!" I thought, but he seemed like a beast, his skin had turned blue and he was very agitated. He was naked and he was wearing only
				a pair of boots, when he saw me he tried to escape. I knew for his blue skin that he had argyria, as a result of probably working with silver. But I had never seen something like that. 
				His violent state suggested as well that he was having some kind of psychotic episode. Holmes and Lestrade came out from the corridor and held him.

				<p>That was the end of Lord Adler's disapeareance. But down the corridor there was something else, as Holmes had discovered.
